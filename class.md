### Belongs To and Has Many Relationships
```ruby
a.author = b # a belongs to b, b has many As
```

### Inherit and Module
```ruby
class SubClass < SuperClass
  # rewrite methods
  def some_rewrite_method
    super # call the same named method in SuperClass
    # do somthing else
  end
end

class SubClass::SuperClass # just give SubClass access to all constants, instance methods, without inherit relationship
  # rewrite methods
end
```

```ruby
module Module
  # module methods
  module NestModule
    # module can be nested
    def self.extended(base) # hook, apply to the module self
      puts "#{base} has been extended by #{self}" # base is the class which extend this module
      base.class_instance_variable_set(:@@all, [])
    end
  end
end

class HasModule
  extend Module::NestModule # extend module as class methods
  include Module # include module as instance methods
end
```
